# The Golden Girls Quotes API

This is an API that currently returns a random quote from one of The Golden Girls. There's no database. It's deployed on fly.io. Everything is hard-coded in the main [`index.js`](./index.js) file which initializes [an Express app](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) and handles GET requests to `/`.

Maybe there is more to come in the future, but for now this is a quick and fun project that I put up in a just a few minutes. :)
